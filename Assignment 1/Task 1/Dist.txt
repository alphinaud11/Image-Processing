Distance between two ships (Euclidean):  184.4142135623731
Distance between two ships (City):  185.0
Distance between two ships (Chess):  184.0

Distance between big ship and left bank (Euclidean):  41.0
Distance between big ship and right bank (Euclidean):  77.0

Distance between small ship and left bank (Euclidean):  42.0
Distance between small ship and right bank (Euclidean):  109.0


- The distances between the ships and the left/right banks are reported only in Euclidean measure as the 
  distances will not differ when we use other distance measures (City-Chess). That is because the distances
  are calculated on the same horizontal line.
