Pre-processing:
- The image is converted to grayscale, then an edge detection algorithm called (Canny) is applied on the 
  grayscale image.

Reasons:
- We detect the edges in order to determine the coordinates of the left and right sides of the big and 
  small ships, as well as the nearest coordinates of the left and right banks with respect to the big 
  and small ships.
